# Plant Disease Detection

Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection project repository. This project aims to detect diseases in plants using deep learning techniques. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze images of plant leaves and identify whether they are affected by diseases.

## Overview

- **Objective:** To assist farmers and agriculturists in early disease detection and management of plant health.
- **Technology:** Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Python, TensorFlow, Keras.
- **Dataset:** [New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)]
- **Model:** A CNN-based model for image classification.

## Features

- Detects diseases in plant leaves from images.
- Provides early disease detection to aid in timely interventions.
- Can be used for various types of plants and diseases.
- Offers an efficient and accurate solution for plant health monitoring.
